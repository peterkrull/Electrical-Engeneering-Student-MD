#### Why so many subjects?

At Aalborg University, Calculation Techniques is a two-semester long split course, containing a total of 6 different subjects. Due to the nature of these individual subjects being smaller, they will for now be grouped together under the name *Calculation Techniques*. At some point there might be significant contributions to these subjects causing them to get their own root folder.
