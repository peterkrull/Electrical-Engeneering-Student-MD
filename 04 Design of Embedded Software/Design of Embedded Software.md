## What does "embedded" mean?

In the context of [electrical engineering](../0X%20Miscellaneous/electrical%20engineering.md) and software development, embedded means that the software and hardware is implemented to have a very specific purpose. This is unlike the more general purpose devices such as desktop computers, smartphone and servers, that serve a virtually uncountably large set of applications.

Embedded devices usually contain low-power *microcontrollers* with purpose-written software. Since these devices need to be inexpensive but effecient, it is common to write the software for embedded platforms in a compiled language like [C](../0X%20Tools/C-lang/C.md).
