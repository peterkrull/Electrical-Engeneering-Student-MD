# Obsidian

In the context of this repository, Obsidian serves as a note taking application that allows for knowledge to be linked between the different subjects in electrical engineering. Since Obsidian is based on the free and open markdown language this repository is futureproof, easy to fork, modify and contribute to. 

While this notes repository is accesible and readable through any texteditor, it is highly recommended to [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) and browse the repository through the program, since this will enable the use of links and knowledge graphs.
