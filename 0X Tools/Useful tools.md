Being a student of [electrical engineering](../0X%20Miscellaneous/electrical%20engineering.md), it is not just important to follow and learn as much as possible from the courses, but some tangential tools are a must to be familiar with at least at a basic level.

## [Programming](Programming.md)

The courses on programming, specifically [imperative programming](../01%20Imperative%20Programming/Imperative%20Programming.md) and [object oriented programming](../02%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Object%20Oriented%20Programming.md) provide some basic knowledge that is relevant for these specific paradigms, but also only scratch the surface of what programming can do for an engineer.

## [Simulating](Simulating.md)

Wether it be for [modeling and control](../05%20Modeling%20and%20Control/Modeling%20and%20Control.md) of something like a quadcopter, or [analog circuit design](../03%20Analog%20Circuit%20Design/Analog%20Circuit%20Design.md) of a powerful [output stage](../03%20Analog%20Circuit%20Design/output%20stage.md), modeling is an essential tool that allows us to "test" and validate our creations without the risk of crashing our precious *prototypes* or releasing the *magic smoke* from our (*sometimes expensive*) hardware, and ensure that we meet the required *performance specifications*.
