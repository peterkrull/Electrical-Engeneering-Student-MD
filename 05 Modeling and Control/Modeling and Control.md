 > Modelling of dynamic systems and feedback systems are some of the key elements in solving EIT5 semester projects. The course takes the students through all major elements in dynamic feedback systems including block diagram representation, modelling of dynamic systems, linearization, common sensors and actuators, time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis and design of P, PI and PID controllers.
