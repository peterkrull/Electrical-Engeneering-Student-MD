# Block Diagram Algebra

\#modeling #block-diagram 

Representing a [Transfer Function](Transfer%20Function.md) as a block diagram, might be preferred when assessing the structure and signal paths of system.

## Reduction

When presented with a large block diagram, you might want to reduce it down to a single block representing the transfer function of the system. It might also be used as a way to simplify certain parts of the diagram, without disturbing the overall functionality of the [Transfer Function](Transfer%20Function.md) it represents.
